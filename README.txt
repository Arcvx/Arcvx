Hello, Teacher! My name is Tran Van Tuan. I'm from Bac Giang, and I attend FPT College to study Electronics Engineering Technology. I enjoy learning about circuits, programming, and smart devices. With my teacher and fellow students, I hope to gain a great deal of knowledge.
       Today, I would like to talk about my most recent vacation. I went to Da Lat. I know it through friends. I went there in December. I went there with my family. I drove there. It took us two hours to complete the drive. During my visit, I stayed there for three nights and four days. I was staying near Xuan Huong Lake. The weather at Da Lat was really cold. The food was excellent there. The people over there were quite friendly. My hotel was spotless and comfortable. I visited several places, including flower gardens, the valley of love, and Dream Hill. In addition, I captured a ton of amazing pictures. I found it to be pleasant. My favorite aspect of Da Lat is its serene and lush green environment. I have never had any negative experiences there.. I would like to go back there again if I have a chance.
Thatâ€™s all I want to say about this topic. Thank you for listening!
